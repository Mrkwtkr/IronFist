### Description ###

Ever felt fists were underrated? That they need more love? Well we do too.

After all those hours of digging with your fists they're still lame, not even a tiny bit stronger!

Well IronFist solves this problem. We've given you the ability to increase your strength. With IronFist you can now use your fist to smash things like a man! Improve it and smash even obsidian to tiny pieces!

However this strength comes at a risk. Don't overdo it or you may get serious injuries. Take a break once in a while to rest or you may punch yourself to death.
